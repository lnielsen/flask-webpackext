Webpack integration for Flask.

*This is an experimental developer preview release.*

Flask-WebpackExt makes it easy to interface with your existing Webpack project
from Flask and does not try to manage Webpack for you. Flask-WebpackExt does
this via:

* Manifests: You tell Webpack to write a ``manifest.json`` using plugins such
  as webpack-manifest-plugin, webpack-yam-plugin or webpack-bundle-tracker.
  Flask-WebpackExt reads the manifest and makes your compiled assets available
  in your Jinja templates.
* CLI for NPM: Flask-WebpackExt provides a Flask CLI so that e.g.
  ``flask webpack install`` will run ``npm install`` in your Webpack project.
  Similarly, ``flask webpack build`` will run ``npm run build``, you just have
  to define in your ``package.json`` if the build script should execute
  ``webpack --config ...`` or e.g. ``node build.js``, or ...?.

Optionally you can use Flask-WebpackExt to also:

* Inject configuration: Flask-WebpackExt will write a ``config.json`` into your
  webpack project, which you can import in your webpack configuration. You
  define what goes in the config, but you can use to let e.g. Webpack know
  about output paths or dynamic entry points.
* Collect bundles: If you Webpack project is spread over multiple Python
  packages, Flask-WebpackExt can help you dynamically assemble the files into a
  Webpack project. This is useful if you don't know until runtime which
  packages are installed.
